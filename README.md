## Software Alchemist by Day, Introverted Explorer by Night

I'm a passionate developer wielding code to craft a better world. By day, I build robust applications (Java, Spring Boot, the works!), but my true quest is harnessing technology for positive impact.

Join me as I navigate the exciting world of software development, explore the frontiers of tech, and maybe even crack the code on social interaction!

### Things I'm WORKING on:
🌐 Being more extroverted (Yes, I'm voluntarily trying to leave my coding cave! 🦸‍♂️). <br>
🏆 AWS DevOps Professional Certification (I'm coming for you, cloud! ☁️). <br>
🖥️ Beta-Tester for the Arc Browser for Windows by TheBrowserCompany (Who knew browsing could be this exciting?! 🌐). <br>
📈 Understanding ATS tools and improving my resume's reach (Making sure robots also recognize my brains! 🤖). <br>
💼 Perpetual Job Search (Because adulting is hard, and I need to pay for my coffee addiction ☕). <br>

### Things I'm PLANNING for:
💻 A Full Stack Development project (got some ideas, just need that "aha" moment). To showcase my development skills and create something of value. <br>

### Things I'm PASSIONATE about:
🌪️ The new "Avatar: The Last Airbender" series on Netflix (heard it's in it's element 🍿). <br>
♟️ Diving deep into GeoPolitics (because the world is one big chessboard). <br>
🛠️ Nerding out over product design decisions (how do people choose where the close button needs to be?). <br>
